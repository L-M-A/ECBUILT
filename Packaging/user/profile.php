	<h2>About Us</h2>
	  <h4>The DA-IICT at Gandhinagar represents Wave-4 of educational innovation in Gujarat.
The first wave was the nationalist wave and led to Gandhian experiments in education including Nai Talim. The Gujarat Vidyapith established in 1920 was a hybrid model of a university based on Gandhian principles.
The second wave led to the establishment of a whole range of educational institutions in Gujarat, mainly private colleges
The third wave, an inspired one, was spearheaded by the industrialist Kasturbhai Lalbhai and the scientist Vikram Sarabhai and led to the establishment of a network of national institutes of international renown. A whole array of remarkable intellectuals provided the leadership of these institutes.
It was in Wave 4 when the focus shifted to higher education and private participation. One of the institutes created during this period is DA-IICT. It is a University under the State Act of Gujarat. The DA-IICT was established in Gandhinagar in 2001. It is the only advanced institute named after the Late Dhirubhai Ambani, the founder of Reliance Group.

In January 2011, a cooperative endeavor called the Network of Engineering Institutions (NEI) was
initiated by Prof. D. Nagchoudhuri of DA-IICT. NEI’s objective is to enhance the quality of PhD
research among the participating Institutions with the help of experts from various IITs. Interactive
Forum for exchange of views and ideas has been formed and workshops are conducted and
evaluated by experts. Currently the focus is on VLSI related research and NEI is getting help of
experts from IIT, Bombay and Delhi. At present, DA-IICT, Mody Institute of Technology & Science,
LNM Institute of Information Technology and Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering are the
member institutions of NEI and shortly it will be extended to other institutions with other focus
areas. This initiative would also enable the sharing of research resources and provide mentorship to
students and their local PhD guides.
During the autumn semester 2011-12, DA-IICT and IIT, Gandhinagar, initiated a process to jointly
offer courses on electronics and communication, mathematics, sciences and humanities.
